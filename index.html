<p>As a biochemistry major, I frequently “lie” with atomic and molecular models to better tell the truth. For instance, organic chemistry students often use model kits such as the one pictured below to work through structural problems. In reality, these models look nothing like the molecules they represent. Atomic nuclei are infinitesimal in volume compared to bond lengths, but in these models the nuclei are relatively large. Also, the nuclei of different elements vary widely. Carbon has twelve times the mass of hydrogen, but in many molecular kits they have the same size. Furthermore, the bond lengths of double bonds are much shorter than the bond lengths of single bonds, but in several kits both bond types have comparable lengths. </p>

<p>However, these models are highly useful tools for visualizing how molecules are structured. Particles at the molecular scale are too bizarre for our brains to process, so we need these models to simplify them. Molecular modeling kits do a good job of representing which atoms are bonded to each other, what type of bond they share, and the overall geometry of a molecule. Those properties determine the reaction behaviors of molecules, which is all we really care about in most cases.  The molecular model below (of hemoglobin) is slightly more realistic, but far more difficult to work with. It’s impossible to make out which atoms are bonded to which. Using a simpler model, such as a line drawing or homology modeling would be much easier to understand.</p>
